              <li>Foods that are in season are typically picked at the peaks of ripeness, which leads to higher concentrations of essential vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. </li>
              <li>Eating seasonally reduces the need for transportation and energy-intensive methods of cultivation and storage, leading to a lower carbon footprint. </li>
              <li>Choosing seasonal produce supports local farmers and markets.</li>
              <li>Most importantly, seasonal foods are tasty and make life more enjoyable. &#x2661; </li>

            <li>The selection of produce as well as its seasonality is based on research that is colored by Alma’s bias, opinions, and experience.</li>
            <li>Some liberties are taken when determining the length of an item’s seasonality. For example, some people may regard beet season as June through November, but I define it as year-round.  
            </li>
            <li>Not all items shown are grown in California.</li>
